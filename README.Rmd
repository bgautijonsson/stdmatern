# stdmatern

This directory is for development of fast and memory-efficient code that creates Mat√©rn precision matrices that have been standardized so that their inverse is a correlation matrix. The code is written in C++ and made available inside R with the `{Rcpp}` packages.

The package can be installed with 

```{r}
#| eval: false
pak::pak("bgautijonsson/stdmatern")
```



```{r}
library(stdmatern)
Q <- make_standardized_matern(dim = 2, rho = 0.5)
```

```{r}
Q
```

```{r}
Q |> solve()
```

Creating and standardizing a 1600x1600 precision matrix

```{r}
bench::mark(
  make_standardized_matern(dim = 40, rho = 0.5)
)
```
